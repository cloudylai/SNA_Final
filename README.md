# SNA_Project
Social Network Analysis Final Project

## Overview
The repository is a duplication of the final team project, link prediction on location-based social network, of NTU Social Network Analysis and Graph Mining Course ([website](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~sdlin/Courses/SNA2014.html)) in Fall, 2014. The Project is worked by Chiu-Te Wang, Liang-Wei Chen, and Chih-Te Lai. The objective of this project is to predict different kinds of users' potential interest in some attractions. In this project, we build a hetergeneous network and extract complicate features from it, and we testify our model on [Gowalla](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html) dataset and make a brief report of the performance of our model in results.
